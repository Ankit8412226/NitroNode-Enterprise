## 🧠 Why NitroNode? (The Philosophy)

The goal of this repository is to solve the "spaghetti code" problem often found in growing Node.js applications. By enforcing **Separation of Concerns (SoC)** and **Layered Architecture**, NitroNode ensures that your codebase remains maintainable even as it scales to millions of users.

### 🏗️ Why Layered Architecture?
Most developers mix business logic with routes or controllers. NitroNode enforces a strict one-way flow:
- **Route**: Only handles URL mapping.
- **Controller**: Thin layer that extracts request data and returns a response. **No business logic here.**
- **Service**: The brain of the app. All business rules, AI logic, and calculations live here.
- **Repository**: The only layer allowed to talk to the Database. This allows you to swap databases or mock data for testing with zero friction.
- **Model**: Pure data schema definition.

### 🛡️ Why Joi for Validation?
Input validation is the first line of defense. We use `Joi` because:
- **Schema-first**: It ensures that only specifically formatted data enters your services.
- **Type Safety**: Prevents common runtime errors caused by unexpected data types.
- **Detailed Errors**: Provides clear, user-friendly feedback on what's missing or wrong.

### ⚡ Why Redis for Security?
Security is not just about passwords; it's about availability.
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevents DDoS and brute-force attacks by limiting requests per IP.
- **IP Blocking**: Automatically identifies and bans malicious IPs that fail multiple logins, reducing server load from bot attacks.
- **Token Blacklisting**: Allows for high-security logout scenarios where tokens must be invalidated before they expire.

### 📬 Why BullMQ for Background Tasks?
Complex apps should never make the user wait for side effects like sending emails or processing AI.
- **Reliability**: If a mail server is down, BullMQ handles retries automatically with exponential backoff.
- **Performance**: Moves heavy computation (like PDF parsing or AI calls) out of the main request-response cycle.
- **Scalability**: Workers can be scaled independently of the main API.

### 🐳 Why Docker?
"It works on my machine" is not an option for enterprise.
- **Environment Parity**: Ensures the exact same versions of Node, MongoDB, and Redis are used across development, staging, and production.
- **Isolation**: Prevents dependency conflicts with other projects on your local machine.

### 📝 Why Swagger (OpenAPI)?
The API is only as good as its documentation.
- **Interactive**: Frontend developers can test endpoints directly from the browser without needing Postman.
- **Standardized**: Follows the industry-standard OpenAPI 3.0 specification.
- **Sync**: Documentation stays in sync with your actual code via JSDoc decorators.

## 📜 Coding Standards
- **Zero console.log**: All logs must go through the Winston logger.
- **Thin Controllers**: Move every ounce of logic to a service.
- **Chained Routes**: Always use `router.route()` for clean, grouped API definitions.
- **Prod Mode Safety**: Stack traces are never leaked to the client in production.
